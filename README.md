# Firebase_Demo
First time writing with Firebase through IOS development

This is a simple project just to try out Firebase which provides remote NoSQL database.

What I have learnt:

- Set up Firebase for IOS project 
- Implement Write, Delete, Update, and Read in this Tab navigation app
- Have tried out a listener to when the UIView-Read is loaded. It will fetch data from database only once with              observeSingleEvent() or realTime update with observe()


How to install:

-just clone and run in xcode 10 and I believe there is no need to install firebase and cocopods in your machine because
 everything is configured in the project
